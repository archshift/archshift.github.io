        <h1>Hacking around the Rust type-system to provide ergonomic bitfields</h1>
<p>So for a while now, I've been trying to figure out how to create a bitfield macro that allows easy, ergonomic use. A few days ago, I found the solution, and now I've published <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bitutils">bitutils</a> to crates.io!</p>
<h2>Some background</h2>
<p>I've been working on and off on an emulator for the 3DS' security processor, as well as a test binary that I cross-compile to the ARM9 processor on the 3DS. Both are written in Rust, and both require heavy use of bitfields. I wanted a solution that allowed me to name the individual fields, and to be somewhat ergonomic (my previous solution required me to do <code>bf!( reg.field1 = newval )</code> for instance).</p>
<h2>First, the syntax</h2>
<p>I defined a <code>bf!</code> macro, used like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">bf!(BitfieldName[u8] {
    field1: 0:3,
    field2: 4:6,
    field3: 7:7
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I can access and modify fields like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut bitfield = BitfieldName::new(0);
bitfield.field1.set(0xF);
return bitfield.field2.get();
</code></pre>

<h2>What hackery is this?</h2>
<p>Well, the <code>bf!</code> macro expands to some pretty gnarly stuff. Let's check it out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">// This is a module, not a struct, because we have to contain the namespace pollution
pub mod BitfieldName {
    #[repr(C)]
    pub struct field1 {
        _dont_instantiate_pls: ()
    }

    #[allow(dead_code)]
    impl field1 {
        #[inline(always)]
        pub fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; u8 {
            // &amp;self MUST always point to the appropriate Bf type.
            let bfptr = self as *const Self as *const Bf;
            let _ = self;
            let val = unsafe { (*bfptr).val };
            bits!(val, $var_low : $var_hi)
        }

        #[inline(always)]
        pub fn set(&amp;mut self, new: u8) {
            // &amp;mut self MUST always point to the appropriate Bf type.
            let bfptr = self as *mut Self as *mut Bf;
            let _ = self;
            let val = unsafe { &amp;mut (*bfptr).val };
            *val ^= bits!(*val, 0:3) &lt;&lt; 0;
            *val |= bits!(new, 0:(3 - 0)) &lt;&lt; 0;
        }
    }

    // ditto for field2, field3

    #[repr(C)]
    pub struct Fields {
        pub field1: field1,
        pub field2: field2,
        pub field3: field3
    }

    #[repr(transparent)]
    #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
    pub struct Bf {
        pub val: $ty,
    }
    impl Bf {
        pub fn new(val: $ty) -&gt; Self {
            Self {
                val: val
            }
        }
    }
    impl $crate::Deref for Bf {
        type Target = Fields;
        fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Fields {
           // We go through Deref here because Fields MUST NOT be moveable.
           unsafe { &amp;*(self as *const Self as *const Fields) } 
        }
    }
    impl $crate::DerefMut for Bf {
        fn deref_mut(&amp;mut self) -&gt; &amp;mut Fields {
           unsafe { &amp;mut *(self as *mut Self as *mut Fields) } 
        }
    }

    pub fn new(val: u8) -&gt; Bf {
        Bf::new(val)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>What's this pointer casting about?</h2>
<p>I needed a way to get around a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of ability to do parametrization on mutability</li>
<li>The lack of ability to conjoin identifiers in macros (which would let me get around (a))</li>
<li>The syntactic noise of chaining method calls</li>
<li>The lack of ability to encode self-referential structs in the type system.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had decided that using struct fields, somehow, was the best way to reference individual field members. But how? Unions were the obvious choice, but I didn't want to use <code>unsafe</code> every time I accessed a bitfield member.</p>
<p>But then I remembered. Zero sized types! ZSTs allow me to add functionality to the type system without bloating my bitfield type and while keeping it <code>Copy</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, I can cast any pointer to a ZST pointer and have it be a valid representation (since, after all, there's nothing to represent!). So the <code>&amp;self</code> and <code>&amp;mut self</code> in the <code>fieldN</code> types really just point to the <code>Bf</code> struct, and I can pointer cast it right back.</p>
<p>And then, I added a little <code>Deref</code> trickery to prevent someone from attempting to <code>Copy</code> or move the <code>Fields</code> type out of the <code>Bf</code> struct, which might put them in serious trouble if they called any function with <code>&amp;self</code> type punning!</p>
