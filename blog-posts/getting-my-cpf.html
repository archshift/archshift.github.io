        <h1>Getting my CPF remotely from the US</h1>
<p>A child of Brazilians, I found myself with the country’s passport but without
the omnipresent CPF number (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas), which functions kind
of like a social security number, except you use it for just about everything in
Brazil from opening bank and phone accounts to buying clothes at the mall.
Naturally, after a few trips back in adulthood I was ready to get it figured
out.</p>
<p>After a fair bit of trial and error, I managed to get mine issued without being
in the country, using only online resources. I catalogued what I learned in the
process.</p>
<p>Here’s what I needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scan of my passport</li>
<li>A picture of me holding my passport opened to the photo page, with all the
  text legible</li>
<li>My birth certificate. I don’t think it needs to be a Brazilian birth
  certificate, but the <em>crucial</em> bit is it needs to have your parent names on
  it. Apparently most identification in Brazil is done by cross referencing you
  and your parents together?</li>
<li>Proof that I’ve fulfilled my military obligations. In my case the proof was a
  little document I got from the consulate that I was excused from military
  service. I’m not certain this is necessary, but I had it and submitted it with
  my requests. This isn’t relevant for minors.</li>
<li>Proof of current (US) residence. I used an internet bill.</li>
<li>My Título do Eleitor (voter registration) number. Also not relevant for
  minors. I didn’t have this either, so I needed to get it first. This is very
  much required! My first request was denied for not having it.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, getting the Título do Eleitor. I used the
<a href="https://www.tse.jus.br/servicos-eleitorais/autoatendimento-eleitoral#/atendimento-eleitor">self-service form here</a>
under “Tire seu Título”. A couple notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I included the military obligation doc here even though it wasn’t clear
  whether it was required.</li>
<li>There was a field for CPF which I obviously didn’t have yet, but I was able to
  leave it blank.</li>
<li>There was no preset option for Passport as a form of identification. I used
  the “other ID” option and my passport number, and explained in the notes (just
  before submitting) that the form of ID used was my passport.</li>
<li>I needed to pay a fine, amounting to less than a dollar, for not having
  registered before 19 years old. The payment portal accepted Pix, which
  requires a local bank account (which requires a CPF to open) or credit card.
  Tragically the credit card option also had a mandatory CPF field!
  Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a way to do this without depending on another
  Brazilian to help me, so I asked my dad to pay with Pix.I now think it might
  be possible to pay with Pix as a foreigner through Xoom, but the service
  charges a chunky fee.</li>
<li>It took a couple days for my request to be approved, but they never sent me an
  email indicating that it was (even though I got emails when previous attempts
  were denied). I checked the status in the self-service portal to find out that
  it was ready. Then I queried my number, again though a different function in
  the portal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I had that, I was ready to request my CPF. This was actually pretty
straightforward, if somewhat bizarre since the process involves sending an email
with sensitive doccuments as attachments… but I guess that’s how they do it in
Brazil! You can see the instructions on
<a href="https://www.gov.br/pt-br/servicos/inscrever-no-cpf-no-exterior">this official explainer page</a>.
There’s not much to note here, except that the instructions have you print an
automatically filled form and sign it, but my e-signature was also accepted.</p>
<p>Hopefully these notes can be useful to any other Brazilians raised outside the
US!</p>
